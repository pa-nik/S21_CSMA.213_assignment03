	Travel Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithm

	Parameters
	----------
	generation : int
		number of iteration to train the algorithm

	population_size : int
		number of tours in the population

	retain_rate : float between 0 ~ 1
		the fraction of the best tour (shortest total distance) 
		in the population to retain, which is then used in the 
		crossover and mutation staget to generate the children 
		for the next generation
	
	mutate_rate : float between 0 ~ 1
		the probability that each tour will mutate

	Example
	-------
	%matplotlib inline

	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

		'TSP_berlin52.txt', 
		skiprows = 1, # the first row is simply the number of cities
		header = None, 
		names = [ 'city', 'x', 'y' ], 
		sep = ' '
	)
	
	# specify the parameters and fit the data

		generation = 5000,

		retain_rate = 0.5,
